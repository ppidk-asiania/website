# PPIDK Asia-Oseania Website

The official web platform of PPIDK Asia-Oseania: public website, member accounts,
administration, online shop and a public API — in one TypeScript monorepo.

## Overview

| Application | Audience                                       | Domain              | Local port |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| **Web**     | Public visitors and signed-in members          | `web.example.org`   | 3000       |
| **Admin**   | Staff: content, events, members, users, audit  | `admin.example.org` | 3001       |
| **Shop**    | Customers: products, cart, checkout, orders    | `shop.example.org`  | 3002       |
| **Gateway** | Third-party systems (versioned REST API `/v1`) | `api.example.org`   | 3003       |

Each application is deployed and fails independently: an admin or shop outage never takes down
the public website.

## Architecture

     └──────────────┴───────┬───────┴───────────────┘
                            │  in-process imports (no shared API service)
       @website/* packages: domain · db · auth · permissions · audit
                            contracts · apikeys · email · ui · observability · config
                            │
     Firebase Auth (one user pool) · Firestore (all data) · Cloud Storage · Resend
```

- **Data** — Cloud Firestore for everything; browsers never access it directly.
- **Identity** — one Firebase Authentication user pool for staff, members and customers.
- **Access** — role-based access control (RBAC) evaluated on the server for every request.
- **Boundaries** — enforced by tooling (`pnpm lint`), not only by convention.

Details: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Getting started

**Requirements:** Node.js 24 LTS, Git, and Corepack (bundled with Node). On Windows, check your
machine with `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\doctor.ps1`.

```bash
corepack enable      # once per machine; provides the pinned pnpm version
pnpm install
pnpm dev             # starts all four applications
```

No `.env` file is needed for the start pages. To connect real services, copy
`apps/<app>/.env.example` to `apps/<app>/.env.local` and use **staging** values only.
See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).

## Commands

| Command          | Purpose                                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`       | Run all applications in watch mode (`pnpm --filter web dev` for one)   |
| `pnpm verify`    | Everything CI runs: format, lint, typecheck, tests, build, secret scan |
| `pnpm test`      | Unit and integration tests (Vitest)                                    |
| `pnpm test:e2e`  | Smoke tests against production builds (Playwright)                     |
| `pnpm lint`      | ESLint and the architecture boundary check                             |
| `pnpm typecheck` | TypeScript in every workspace                                          |
| `pnpm build`     | Production build of every application                                  |
| `pnpm format`    | Format with Prettier                                                   |

## Branches and environments

| Branch    | Environment            | Firebase project        |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `dev`     | Development (all work) | `ppidk-website-staging` |
| `staging` | Staging (release test) | `ppidk-website-staging` |
| `prod`    | Production (live)      | `ppidk-website-prod`    |

Work is committed to `dev` and promoted by pull request `dev → staging → prod`.
No other branches are created. Staging can never reach production data — this is enforced in code.
See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) and [docs/environment.md](docs/environment.md).

## Documentation

- **Project-wide guides** live in [`docs/`](docs/README.md): architecture, development,
  environments, deployment, security and disaster recovery.
- **Feature documentation** lives next to the code, in each workspace's own `docs/` folder
  (for example [`packages/domain/docs`](packages/domain/docs/README.md)).
- Each workspace has a `README.md` describing what it owns and how to use it.

## Engineering rules

1. Reuse before adding; keep changes small and consistent with the existing code.
2. Write the test first, then the implementation; run `pnpm verify` before pushing.
3. Authorization is always checked on the server — never trust the browser.
4. Never commit secrets, `.env` files or service-account keys.
5. Update the relevant README or feature doc in the same commit as the change.
