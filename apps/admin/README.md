# admin

Staff administration for content, events, members, users and audit.

## Responsibilities

- CMS: news, articles, pages, galleries, events, organization and chapters
- Members: approval and profile access (`members.*` permissions)
- Users and roles, audit log and 14-day revert
- Tools: QR codes, Zoom meeting requests, calendar feed

## Structure

| Path                           | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/app/`                     | Pages (App Router). Never cached: every request is authenticated.       |
| `src/server/context.ts`        | `getPrincipal()` — session → Firebase → roles in Firestore; staff only. |
| `src/server/guarded-action.ts` | `createGuardedAction()` — the only way to write an admin mutation.      |
| `src/server/user-directory.ts` | Looks up a user's roles (fails closed until implemented).               |

## Rules

- Domain `admin.example.org`, local port **3001**.
- Only accounts with a staff role (`admin.access`) get in; members and customers are refused.
- Every mutation: authenticate → validate → authorize → domain logic → audit (same transaction).
- Never reads or writes Firestore from the browser.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter admin dev     # http://localhost:3001
pnpm --filter admin build
pnpm --filter admin lint
```
