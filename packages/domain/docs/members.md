# Member profiles

Collected once per user in `memberProfiles/{uid}` and reused for event registrations
(registrations reference the user; they do not copy personal data).
Schema and validation: `packages/domain/src/members/profile.ts` (Zod, shared by every app).

## Access

- **The member**: reads/edits their own profile (`profile.read_own` / `profile.write_own`).
- **Staff with `members.read`**: basic fields only (`toBasicView`).
- **Staff with `members.read_pii`**: all fields — `chapter_admin` only for their chapter.
- **Exports**: `members.export` (superadmin only by default), logged as a security event.
- **Never**: the third-party gateway (lint-enforced), public pages, audit snapshots (restricted
  values are replaced with `[changed]`/`[unchanged]`; such changes are not revertible from the log).

## Personal data protection (UU PDP, Law 27/2022)

- Consent is recorded with the policy version; the privacy policy page must exist before launch.
- Collect only the fields above. Gender and date of birth are collected — confirm the purpose
  is stated in the privacy policy.
- Members can request a copy or deletion of their data (self-service export/delete in a later phase).
- Retention: define how long alumni profiles are kept after `estimatedGraduationYear`
  (proposal: 2 years, then delete or anonymize). **Decision needed.**
- Breach handling: notify affected members and the authority within 3×24 hours (UU PDP Art. 46).
