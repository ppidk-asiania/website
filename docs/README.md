# Documentation

## Where documentation lives

| Kind                  | Location                        | Example                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Project-wide guides   | `docs/` (this folder)           | Architecture, deployment, security |
| What a workspace owns | `<workspace>/README.md`         | `apps/admin/README.md`             |
| Feature documentation | `<workspace>/docs/<feature>.md` | `packages/domain/docs/members.md`  |

Put a feature doc in the workspace that **owns** the feature (where its main code lives).
If a feature spans several workspaces, document it in the one that owns the business rule
and link to it from the others.

## Project-wide guides

- [Architecture](architecture.md) — applications, packages and dependency rules
- [Development](development.md) — local setup and daily commands
- [Environments](environment.md) — development, staging, production
- [Deployment](deployment.md) — branches, CI/CD, rollback
- [Security](security.md) — controls and threat model
- [Disaster recovery](disaster-recovery.md) — backups and restore

Add a row here when you add a feature doc.

## Feature doc template

Keep it short. Document what a future developer needs, not how you got there.

```markdown
# <Feature name>

## What it does

One paragraph, in plain words.

## Where it lives

- Code: `packages/.../src/...`
- Tests: `tests/unit/...`

## How to use it

Short example or the main entry points.

## Rules and assumptions

Permissions, validation, limits, data stored.

## Configuration

Environment variables or settings (or "None").
```
